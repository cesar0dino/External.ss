<p>It’s frigid and you’re surrounded by ice. You wonder how any animal could survive in this extreme cold.
    Then a polar bear and her cubs lumber by, and in the ocean behind them a whale erupts from the water.</p>

<p>Polar bears primarily eat seals. Polar bears often rest silently at a seal's breathing hole in the ice, waiting for a seal in the water to surface.
    A polar bear may also hunt by swimming beneath the ice. But climate change is making it harder for polar bears to hunt.
    Ice melts earlier and re-forms later than it has in the past. Without the sea ice, the polar bear must scavenge for other, less nutritious food.</p>

<p>Walruses have long tusks and a prominent mustache. These large marine mammals are found near the Arctic Circle.
    They are extremely social and snort and bellow loudly at their companions. During the mating season they are quite aggressive.</p>
