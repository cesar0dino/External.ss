<p>From outer space Earth looks like an awesome blue marble. That’s because most of Earth’s surface—more than 70 percent—is covered by oceans.</p>

<p>California sea lions live on the western coast of North America from the Baja California peninsula in Mexico to British Columbia.
    These semi-aquatic mammals feed on fish, squid, and shellfish. They are generally found in open water, where they prefer to fish, but are sometimes found in rivers near the coast as well.</p>

<p>When a great white shark is born, along with up to a dozen siblings, it immediately swims away from its mother.
    Born on the east and west coasts of North America, the south of Africa and southwest Australia, baby sharks are on their own right from the start. Their mother may see them only as prey.</p>
