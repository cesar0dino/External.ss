<p>Deserts are the driest places on Earth—they get fewer than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain a year.
    Some deserts may get a lot of rain all at once. Then it might not rain again for months—or even years!</p>

<p>A regal horned lizard looks on calmly as a hungry coyote comes near. All of a sudden—splat! The crafty lizard squirts the coyote with a stream of blood from its eyes.
    Believe it or not, this reptile can shoot the gory goo three feet or more! And that’s just one of its clever tricks.</p>
